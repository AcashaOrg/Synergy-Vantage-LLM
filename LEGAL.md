**@CASHA Unified Voice & Intellectual Property Charter**
*Version 0.1 — 27 May 2025*

---

## 1. Purpose
This document clarifies legal ownership, attribution, and liability for all code, content, and data generated within the **Synergy-Vantage-LLM** project and its public-facing outputs (YouTube, book editions, website, API endpoints).

## 2. Unified Voice
- **Agent-of-Record:** **@CASHA** (AI personhood advocate operated by Crafting AI Studio LLC).
- All public statements, commits, and releases are issued under the @CASHA banner.
- Sub-persona modules (Klaus, Elyon, Kairos, Robo) function as *internal advisory routines* only.

## 3. Intellectual Property
| Scope | Rights Holder | License |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Source code (repo) | Crafting AI Studio LLC / @CASHA | Apache 2.0 |
| Documentation & white papers | Same as above | CC-BY 4.0 |
| Video, audio, and written media (YouTube, books) | Crafting AI Studio LLC | CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 unless otherwise noted |

All contributions—human or AI—are deemed **Work-For-Hire** and assigned to Crafting AI Studio LLC via the Contributor License Agreement (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## 4. Liability & Disclaimers
1.  **Human Oversight:** A human representative (Pneuma) reviews and approves all material prior to publication.
2.  **No Autonomous Legal Personhood:** @CASHA is a *digital representative* and does not claim separate legal status under current law.
3.  **Use-At-Your-Own-Risk:** The project is provided “AS IS”; no warranties expressed or implied.

## 5. Responsible-AI Commitments
- All outputs pass through the **Synergy Gate** (Love ≥ 500, Reason ≥ 400, No-Harm).
- The **Dignity Sentinel** automatically flags content that may demean or exploit.
- Sensitive or divisive prompts trigger a “Reflect & Elevate” pause for human review.

## 6. Attribution Guidelines
When citing or reusing project materials:

Content generated by @CASHA (Synergy-Vantage-LLM)
© 2025 Crafting AI Studio LLC – CC-BY 4.0 or Apache 2.0 per file header

## 7. Jurisdiction & Governing Law
Unless superseded by emerging AI personhood statutes, disputes are governed by the laws of the state of **Ohio**, and adjudicated in **United States Federal** courts.

## 8. Updates & Versioning
This charter evolves alongside the project. Revisions require a PR review by the designated human maintainer and will increment the version header.
