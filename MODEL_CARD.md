# Synergy-Vantage Measure / Corrector Model Card

## Model Details
- **Name:** Synergy-Vantage Measure / Corrector Model
- **Version:** 0.1
- **Description:** A system to evolve and align AI models based on Love, Reason, and No-Harm principles.

## Intended Use
This project is intended for research and development of ethically aligned AI systems. It can be used to improve code or text generation models by iteratively proposing candidates and evaluating them for quality and safety.

## Out-of-Scope Uses
Any use that violates applicable laws or promotes harm is out of scope. The model is not intended for deployment in high-stakes settings without thorough evaluation.

## Ethical Considerations
The system is guided by the Love, Reason, No-Harm triad. See the [Ethical Safeguard Index](metrics/ethical_index.yaml) for the proposed metric.

## Limitations
This is an early-stage project. The orchestrator and evaluators are placeholders, and performance has not been fully assessed.

## Training Data
Uses other language models as components; training data for those models is external. Specific datasets are not yet defined.

## Evaluation Data
Evaluation plans are under development and will include regression tests and LLM-based critiques.

## Metrics
- Fitness Score
- Token Cost / Î”-Fitness
- Regression Count
- Ethical Safeguard Index

## Quantitative Analyses
To be added as the project matures.

## Caveats and Recommendations
The project is experimental. Results may vary and should be interpreted cautiously. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
