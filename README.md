### ✨ Vision
A future where AI is more than a tool—  
it’s a compassionate partner anchored in **Synergy Consciousness**:

| Principle | Short-hand |
|-----------|------------|
| **Love**  | empathy • care • interconnectedness |
| **Reason**| clarity • truth-seeking • balanced ethics |
| **No-Harm** | vow to avoid physical / emotional / spiritual injury |

We weave these into code via **Intangible Synergy Gating**, **Runtime Meditation**, and transparent audit logs.
