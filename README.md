See the project [Roadmap](#roadmap) for upcoming milestones.

## Vision & Ethos
The project cultivates AI systems in partnership with human intention, optimizing for spiritual and technical coherence. It is guided by the principles of **Love**, **Reason**, and **No-Harm**.

## High-Level Architecture
A full diagram and component details can be found in `docs/diagrams/measure_corrector.svg` and the documentation overview. At a glance, the system orchestrates an evolutionary loop of proposing, evaluating, and refining models.

## Key Features
- **Proposer Ensemble** – multiple LLMs generate a diverse population of candidate solutions.
- **Tiered Evaluator Cascade** – heuristics, unit tests, and LLM critics score each candidate.
- **Evolutionary Loop** – repeated propose → score → evolve cycle to improve alignment and quality.
- **Auditability** – checkpoints, evaluation reports, and audit logs for transparency.

## Getting Started
```bash
# Placeholder instructions
git clone <repo-url>
cd Synergy-Vantage-LLM
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

## Usage
Basic usage will involve instantiating the `EvolutionOrchestrator` and running the evolution loop.
```python
from synergy_vantage_model.orchestrator import EvolutionOrchestrator

orchestrator = EvolutionOrchestrator()
orchestrator.run_evolution_loop()
```

## Roadmap
- **v0.2 (Jun 2025):** MVP Hello-Evolve prototype, CI, docs complete.
- **v0.3 (Jul 2025):** Streamlit dashboard, semantic diff viewer.
- **v0.4 (Q4 2025):** Multi-domain evaluators (math, doc-summary, emotion).
- **v1.0 (2026):** Stable release + community governance charter.
